# crazy-recipe-viewer

I had a crazy idea that you see a recipe in a type of infographic-like way.

Eventually, take a recipe and enter it. Then it spits out in steps organized differently, more visually. And more closer to real life time.

Many times I'll be doing something and it says, now add the rest of the butter. I'm like, oh geez, how much butter is that? So I have to reread the ingredients list, and reread the other steps, then calculate how much butter that is because I wasn't experienced enough to take it all out at the beginning.

If I could organize it with pictures and what exactly you need to do next without having to read it all again. That's what I'm looking for. If you know what manufacturing floor routings are, it's like that. Directions for you to do right now. It's kind of like I'm in the middle of a recipe and I want to say, hey someone helping me cook, what do I do next? So I don't have to think too much.

## Progress

Not sure if this is possible, so I'm just going to play around with it and see where it goes. It might need some iteration. Probably a lot of iteration. Especially the splitting up the words into sections and steps part.
